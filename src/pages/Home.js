                    <p>His citation read: On 17 November 1962, a Battalion of the Garhwal Rifles was occupying a defensive position near Nuranang bridge, in NEFA. Rifleman Jashwant Singh’s company was subjected to a series of attacks by the Chinese forces. Three attacks made by enemy were unsuccessful, but the enemy managed to bring forward a medium machine gun (MMG) very close to one of our platoons and weakened its defenses. Rifleman Jashwant Singh Rawat and two othe them returned to their own position under the covering fire provided by Lance Naik. As they were entering their trenches, the enemy opened automatic fire from close range. Rifleman Jashwant singh rawat was hit on the head and died on the spot, still holding the MMG in his hand. The other rifleman, though badly wounded, managed to enter the trench and was saved.

The exceptional courage and initiative shown by rifleman Jashwant Singh Rawat in the face intense enemy fire were in the best traditions of our Army.  </p>
